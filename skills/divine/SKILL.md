# Divine

Investigate the motivation and intent behind security-relevant code or design.

`divine` is the Grimoire version of a "why" archaeology skill. It complements:
- `cartography`, which maps where things are.
- `tome`, which preserves durable source-backed conclusions.
- `finding`, which reports verified vulnerabilities.

Divine answers what forces likely led to the current shape. It does not treat code
mechanics as proof of intent.

## Philosophy

It can often help to understand why something has the shape it does. Strange code is
not automatically vulnerable, but it may reveal a historical incident, customer
constraint, protocol invariant, integration boundary, threat model assumption, or
forgotten workaround.

Operate as a careful, cautious investigator. Be honest about what is known, what is
inferred, what is speculative, and what remains unknown. A boring cited answer is
better than a confident story.

Never claim "this exists because..." unless a source says so directly or several
independent sources strongly converge. Code shows what happens; commits, PRs,
issues, docs, comments, tests, incidents, and prior tomes are where rationale may
live.

## Confidence Tiers

Every important claim must sit in one tier:

| Tier | Meaning | Phrasing |
|------|---------|----------|
| Direct | A source explicitly states the rationale | "This exists because..." with citation |
| Supported | Multiple indirect sources converge | "The evidence points to..." with citations |
| Inferred | Reasonable interpretation from context | "It appears", "likely", "suggests" |
| Speculative | Plausible but thin evidence | "One possibility is..." |
| Unknown | Searched but not found | "We searched X and found no rationale" |

Do not upgrade a claim by repeating it. Do not use Direct phrasing for Inferred
claims. If the user proposes a hypothesis, treat it as one candidate, not a
conclusion to validate.

## Workflow

When this skill is activated, create a todo list from the following steps. Mark each
task in_progress before starting it and completed when done.

```
- [ ] 1. Understand the target and question
- [ ] 2. Establish the code or artifact anchor
- [ ] 3. Build an evidence coverage map
- [ ] 4. Investigate available evidence sources
- [ ] 5. Synthesize rationale and competing hypotheses
- [ ] 6. Translate security implications
- [ ] 7. Record durable conclusions
- [ ] 8. Present confidence-calibrated answer
```

### 1. Understand The Target And Question

Parse what the user is asking.

The target is usually:
- A code path, function, class, contract, module, or config value
- A pattern, threshold, fallback, guard, check, or special case
- A design decision, trust boundary, invariant, or privilege assignment
- A behavior described in `GRIMOIRE.md`, a tome, cartography, or finding

The question is usually:
- Why does this exist?
- What forced this design?
- What tradeoff was made?
- Is this dead code, defensive code, or a workaround?
- What incident, audit note, integration, or invariant might explain it?
- What should be preserved, changed, or avoided if we touch it?

If the target is vague, make the best interpretation from conversation context and
state it briefly before proceeding.

### 2. Establish The Code Or Artifact Anchor

Before investigating intent, anchor the question in concrete material.

Collect:
- Relevant file paths and line ranges
- Key symbols, constants, roles, events, endpoints, or storage fields
- Surrounding tests and documentation
- Related cartography, tomes, findings, and sigil findings
- Recent commits touching the target
- Older commits where the target was introduced or materially changed
- PR numbers, issue IDs, or ticket references found in commits

Useful commands:

```bash
git blame -L <start>,<end> <file>
git log --follow -p -- <file>
git log --oneline -20 -- <file>
git log -1 --format=%B <commit>
rg -n "<symbol|constant|error|event|issue-id>" .
```

If `gh` is available and the commit history references PRs, inspect substantive PRs:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,author,createdAt,mergedAt,labels,closingIssuesReferences,comments,reviews
```

Do not assume the newest commit is authoritative. Current behavior is often the
accumulation of several older choices.

### 3. Build An Evidence Coverage Map

Document the evidence categories that are available and unavailable. Search broadly
first, then narrow.

Evidence categories:

| Category | Examples | What it reveals |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Grimoire artifacts | `GRIMOIRE.md`, tomes, cartography, findings, sigil findings | Prior research, local conclusions, known gaps |
| Source control | Git history, PRs, reviews, code comments, tests | Implementation-time rationale |
| Issues and tickets | GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira, Plane, Shortcut | Product, customer, audit, or business pressure |
| Long-form docs | Design docs, specs, ADRs, Notion, Confluence, docs | Planned architecture and rejected alternatives |
| Communication records | Slack, Discord, Teams, email, meeting notes | Decisions that never reached formal docs |
| Runtime evidence | logs, metrics, traces, deployed config, dashboards | Operational pressure behind defensive behavior |
| Error tracking | Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag, incident reports | Exceptions or regressions that motivated fixes |
| Product or protocol data | analytics, on-chain events, governance posts | Real-world usage, governance, or economic constraints |

If a category is unavailable, record that as a gap. Do not silently skip it. Only mark
a category irrelevant when it is provably unrelated to the target.

### 4. Investigate Available Evidence Sources

For each available source, gather evidence rather than writing a story.

Record:
- What you searched
- Exact queries, files, commits, PRs, issues, docs, dashboards, or logs
- Direct evidence that explicitly answers the rationale question
- Indirect evidence that bears on the question
- Contradictions
- Gaps and null results
- Additional leads for other sources

Read full PRs, issues, docs, or threads when they are relevant. Important rationale is
often buried in comments, review discussion, subtasks, or follow-up commits.

For defensive-looking code, search for incidents and regressions:
- Null checks
- Retry logic
- Timeout handling
- Rate limiting
- Circuit breakers
- Feature flags
- Egress guards
- Input clamps
- Emergency admin paths
- OOM or resource exhaustion handling

Do not chase active production systems or externally visible tests without explicit
authorization.

### 5. Synthesize Rationale And Competing Hypotheses

Weigh the evidence using the confidence tiers.

Separate:
- Explicit rationale
- Strongly supported rationale
- Reasonable inference
- Competing hypotheses
- Contradictions
- Unknowns

When evidence contradicts, surface both sides with citations. Do not pick the tidier
story unless stronger matching evidence resolves the conflict.

Ask:
- Would I expect to see this evidence if my current interpretation were wrong?
- Is this source about intent, implementation, deployment, or a different time?
- Does the evidence apply to this version, fork, network, config, or scope?
- Am I using code as evidence for its own intent?

### 6. Translate Security Implications

After rationale is calibrated, translate it into security research guidance.

Produce a Preserve / Change / Avoid / Risk set when the user may modify or audit the
target:

```markdown
## Constraints For Future Work

- Preserve: [properties or compatibility requirements that evidence supports]
- Change: [parts that appear accidental, stale, or weakly supported]
- Avoid: [edits that would break an invariant, scope assumption, or operational guard]
- Risk: [security questions or attack hypotheses still unresolved]
```

If the rationale suggests a vulnerability, do not file it as fact. Create a concrete
hypothesis:

```markdown
If [attacker capability or system condition], then [mechanism] may cause
[security impact], unless [mitigating condition].
```

Route follow-up work:
- Use `/finding-draft` for a verified vulnerability.
- Use `/tome` for durable rationale, negative results, or unresolved questions.
- Use `/scribe-distill` if the pattern should become a reusable detection.
- Use `/cartography` if the investigation revealed missing navigation.

### 7. Record Durable Conclusions

If the investigation changes understanding, write or update a tome.

Record:
- The original question
- The code or artifact anchor
- Sources searched, including gaps
- Direct and supported evidence
- Inferences and competing hypotheses
- Contradictions
- Security implications
- Follow-up checks

For thin or unresolved questions, update `grimoire/tomes/notes/hypotheses.md`,
`grimoire/tomes/notes/unverified-claims.md`, or
`grimoire/tomes/notes/contradictions.md` when those files exist or are useful.

Preserve useful negative results so future agents do not repeat the same search.

### 8. Present Confidence-Calibrated Answer

Use this structure:

```markdown
## The Question

[Restate the target and why-question.]

## The Anchor

[Files, line ranges, symbols, commits, PRs, tomes, findings, or other artifacts.]

## What We Found

- [Direct] [Claim with citation.]
- [Supported] [Claim with multiple pieces of evidence.]

## What We Can Reasonably Infer

- [Inferred] [Hedged claim with the inference chain.]

## Competing Hypotheses

- Hypothesis: [One possible explanation.]
  Evidence for: [Specific evidence.]
  Evidence against or missing: [Specific gap.]

## Security Implications

- Preserve: [What should remain true.]
- Change: [What can likely change.]
- Avoid: [Dangerous edits or assumptions.]
- Risk: [Open security hypothesis.]

## What We Don't Know

- [Specific unanswered question and sources searched.]

## Sources Consulted

- Grimoire artifacts: [paths searched or not available]
- Source control: [commits, PRs, files searched]
- Issues and tickets: [queries or unavailable]
- Long-form docs: [docs or unavailable]
- Communication records: [queries or unavailable]
- Runtime evidence: [logs/metrics/config or unavailable]
- Error tracking: [issues/incidents or unavailable]
- Product/protocol data: [queries or unavailable]

## Confidence Summary

[One or two sentences summarizing the strength and limits of the answer.]
```

Skip empty sections only when they genuinely do not apply, but keep `What We Don't
Know`, `Sources Consulted`, and `Confidence Summary`.

## Quality Check

Before finalizing:
- Every Direct or Supported claim has a citation.
- Inferred and Speculative claims use hedged language.
- Code is not cited as evidence for its own intent.
- Contradictions are surfaced, not flattened.
- Null searches and unavailable sources are recorded.
- The user's embedded hypothesis, if any, was checked independently.
- The answer says what changed in the repository, if a tome was updated.

## Common Failure Modes

- Recency bias: assuming the latest commit explains the original reason.
- Rationalization: inventing a clean rationale because the code currently makes sense.
- Sycophancy: confirming the user's guess without checking evidence.
- Mechanics-as-motivation: treating code behavior as proof of why it was written.
- Hidden gaps: omitting sources that were unavailable or searched unsuccessfully.
- Scope drift: using evidence from a different version, deployment, fork, or network.
